The availability and depth of big data have had a profound impact on every industry over the past decade. Healthcare is no exception. The best-used data in healthcare has been a catalyst for patient-centric improvements in nearly every corner of the sector. There have been increases in disease prevention, information about COVID-19 (believe me, it could be worse), as well as cost reductions to increase access to affordable treatments.




The population will continue to grow and life expectancies are projected to increase, but with the help of big data and smart hospitals, these changes can be managed. Big Data is expected to aid healthcare management in a number of ways which includes; making it easier for providers to make more efficient decisions about their patients' care plans based on available evidence-based treatments or procedures that work best for those particular cases. It also allows hospital staff members such as nurses, physicians technicians, etc., to have better information at hand when they need it most so crucial medical details like allergies and prescriptions don't go unchecked because there's no time to look them up during an emergency a situation where every second counts.




As populations continue increasing worldwide along with increased lifespans thanks to advances in health care.

Predictive analytics are transforming healthcare as the data pools being used for management purposes become more sharable. As electronic health records (EHRs) continue to grow in prevalence, so do predictive analytic applications because patients can now approve their personal information and share it with doctors across the globe who need similar demographics or side effects when prescribing treatments that have worked before




\- something they may not know without this technology. With deep patient pools available through EHRs, physicians around the world will be able to better prescribe treatment plans tailored specifically towards each individual's 

needs which is a major step forward for medical care!




Telehealth has been a priority for many people, and COVID-19 is a good example of it. But it has been there since the beginning. Telehealth, when integrated with real-time data from apps and devices that allow for improved patient self-care (and data collection throughout the process), can be used to provide consultations previously impossible via telephone or videoconferencing. This includes those between doctors working remotely and patients who are able to communicate at their homes using their computers.




One of the most common complaints about hospital care is the endless hunt many patients go through to find the right healthcare provider. Patients who are frustrated will often go to the ER instead of seeking treatment. This can lead to long waits and costly medical bills. Analytics and big data can be used to help patients feel confident that they are being treated in the right areas, thereby ensuring that emergency rooms are open when needed.




Healthcare will continue to have numerous reasons to explore big data, diversify its use and improve patient care. With new opportunities being created every week for healthcare, the data industry is projected to grow from $169bn (2018) up to $274bn by 2022.
