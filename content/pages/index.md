    content: >
      I received Bachelor and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering degree
      from Toyohashi University of Technology (Japan), and PhD in physics from
      the Graduate University of Advanced Studies. I started my carrier by
      providing an engineering solution to the scientist community in
      biomedical, nanotechnology, and biosensors areas. The projects started
      with the designing of hardware and software from the conceptual phase,
      followed by the implementation phase, writing software for the system and
      data acquisition, and finally develop data analysis & reporting system.


      Later I shifted to the managerial role to lead mobile apps, cloud
      solutions, artificial intelligence, analytics, web solutions, mobile
      health, telehealth, eHealth, wearable devices, internet of things (IoT),
      data healthcare, and digital healthcare products. I am passionate for Life
      Science and Healthcare and improving patients/users wellbeing through the
      use of Data and Digital health technologies. Enhance the overall patients
      and users experience through the use of emerging digital solutions. I have
      extensive management, R\&D, leadership and mentoring experience for
      in-house and remote team in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan,
      Bangladesh, and India. Currently, I am working as a "Digital Healthcare
      Solutions Specialist" at Omron Healthcare, Singapore & Japan.
