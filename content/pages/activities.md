## ICANN 49 Ambassadors

With Sheau Ching Chong and Teddy Mantoro, I was selected as ICANN 49 Ambassadors (March 2014) by ISIF Asia for my social work. I am the co-founder of biggani.org (a Bengali language-based portal on science) and contributed for Shikkhok to provide education to the ruler people of Bangladesh.
